## Material:
0.5 M Acetic Acid preparation (200 ml):
1. 5.753 ml concentrated (17.381 M) glacial acetic acid (99.5%)
2. 194.247 ml fresh Milli-Q
3. Filter on 0.22 mm PES filtration system.  Seal bottle in glove bag.  Only open bottle in glove bag.
 
**Apparatus:**
1. Laminar flow hood
2. Nitrile gloves
3. Lab coat
4. 50 ml Falcon tubes vials (sterile; VWR cat. No. 21008-940)
5. Centrifuge 4°C

## Protocol

1. Using a laminar flow hood, wipe down completely with 10% bleach.
2. Weigh ~1g cleaned ground coral skeleton powder into Falcon tube.  Open powder tube only in glove bag to minimize contamination.
	a. You must use specifically Falcon tubes.  Other tubes contain polymers that leach during decalcification and interfere with enzymatic digestion before sequencing.
3. Add 15 ml 0.5M acetic acid.  Vortex.  
4. Close the tube with parafilm and shake gently (~30 rpm) at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours, subsequently open the tube to release gasses.  Tube should be angled to allow maximum mixing of powder and acid.
* Acid-insoluble organic matrix (IOM) will appear as a fluffy/floaty white substance before centrifugation.  It will pellet upon centrifugation.
* Supernatants can be combined for each sample.
5. Centrifuge powder and supernatant at 4300 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
6. Pipette supernatant containing acid-soluble organic matrix (SOM) to a second 50ml Falcon tube.  Store supernatant at 4°C.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all appears completely dissolved, around 4 times. Insoluble fraction will appear similar to the undissolved powder<sup>1</sup>. Try again to dissolve it with 1ml of acid. volume of acetic acid depends on powder leftover.
8. After finishing the dissolve part, combine the supernatant falcon with the original reaction falcon (Maximum 30ml per falcon).
9. Place all tubes in -80°C as horizontally as possible so the liquid will freeze in an angle (around 70°).  
10. Place in the lyophilizer overnight, until dry.

 <sup>1</sup>There is no need to shake for 2hrs. can check that pH is around 4.5 (using a laxmus paper) – then redo
